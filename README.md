# rmDesings

This is my little place for sharing designs, graphics and freebees.

## Cake

Here is a cake i drew for an app. In the end we had to scrap it, because the feature got removed. I saw it lonely on my pc and wanted to share it :)

## Bowling

A friend asked me to show here some design changes she can do for her bowling site to improve it. Lately i found the rough work and liked the symbols so much, i polished them up for fun. 

## Rockfist

As part of an university project i created this little icon for a music platform. I just reworked it a little bit.

## Animals

### Bunny

A coworker asked me to create a gift card for Easter, and as part of this i designed this little cute bunny. Now i created a nice vectorized version of this bunny.

### Pig

My niece once told my mother as diet tip: "Just don't eat!". As reminder i created a little drawing and this pig is the mascot. Now vectorized :)
